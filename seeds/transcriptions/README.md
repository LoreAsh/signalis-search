## Basic JSON cheatsheet

{} = object
  -Objects have a key value pair ex.
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Adler's Diary"
  }
  ```
  -Keys and values must be wrapped in quotes

[] = array (it contains multiple items)


Arrays are *required* for values that *might* contain multiple values, even if it only currently contains one value.

## Basic Notes
\n means line break (use this instead of creating a line break in editor)
