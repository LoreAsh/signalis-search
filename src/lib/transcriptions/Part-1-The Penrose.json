			"Penrose-type vessels of the Eusan People's Navy are low-cost exploration vessels deployed beyond the solar system's edge in the search for planets and moons fit for habitation or rich in natural resources to support the continuous growth of our great Nation.",
			"All Penrose vessels are piloted by a Gestalt Scout Officer supported by a Land Survey/Ship Technician Replika (LSTR). This 'partner system' of Gestalt-Replika cooperation has proved successful in countless previous scout operations. Mutual control and support allow both the Gestalt officer and the technician Replika to perform at their optimal capacity.",
			"Once the Vessel is catapulted towards the edge of the solar system by an Orbital Mass Driver, the pilot may adjust the course from the flight deck, while the Replika will take care of the mechanical maintenance of the vessel."
