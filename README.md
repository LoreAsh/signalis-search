## Introduction

This is an unofficial, fan-made site for searching memories in [Signalis]https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/. I hope that this will help players dig into the lore and discuss it more easily with each other.

[Signalis]https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/ is a survival horror game, by Rose-Engine, with a fantastic atmosphere and great environmental story telling. Players can explore and uncover various journal entries. I built this site to make searching through them accessible.

## Technology

This site was built using Nextjs, Tailwind CSS, and Typescript. I used Postgres as a database and Algolia as the search engine.
